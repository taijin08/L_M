## How models work

Start with a model called "*Descision Tree*"
(basic model)

- Capturing **training** data: **fitting** or **training** of the model

- Apply models to **predict** for new data

Capture more factors using *Deeper* Trees (has more splits)
Tracing through the tree, picking path according to characteristics. Finally meet the prediction on the bottom, which is called the **leaf**

Library: ***Scikit-Learn (sklearn)***

- **Define:** the model type
- **Fit:** capture patterns from data
- **Predict:** predict for new data
- **Evaluate:** determine how accurate the model is
