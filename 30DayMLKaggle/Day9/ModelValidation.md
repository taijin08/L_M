## What is **model validation**?

in most cases, the measure of the model quality is *accuracy*

**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

$$\text{error}=\text{actual}-\text{predict}$$

**in-sample scores:** use a single sample for both build and evaluate the model

**make prediction on new data: validation data**
break the data into 2 pieces: training and validation
